            <h3><span>User</span> Research</h3>
            <p>
              Initially. in person interviews were conducted with both current
              dog owners who had aspirations to adopt another dog, and first
              timers who had never owned a dog before.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, after the first round of interviews, it seemed that the
              current dog owners had a lot more experience in ways dog ownership
              could go wrong, so additional interviews with current and past dog
              owner’s were conducted, regardless of whether they were interested
              in adopting or not.
            </p>

            <p>
              While not directly linked to the adoption process, this additional
              information proved invaluable.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="mini-column">
            <h3><span>Pain</span> Points</h3>
            <h4>Perfect Match</h4>
            <p>
              Some users had concerns that if they adopted a dog online, they
              wouldn’t be able to get a feel for the dog’s personality.
            </p>

            <h4>Am I Ready?</h4>
            <p>
              A common pain point came in the form of concern regarding whether
              or the user could afford a dog, especially among first time dog
              owners who had little experience in this area.
            </p>

            <h4>Paperwork</h4>
            <p>
              Many users were excited about adopting a dog, but many had no
              experience with the adoption process, leading users to be nervous
              about what paperwork might be involved and filling it out
              correctly.
            </p>

            <h4>Medical</h4>
            <p>
              Primarily amongst current and past dog owners, there was a concern
              about the dog’s health, and whether or not new dog owners were
              equipped with all the knowledge needed to keep a dog healthy.

              Adopting a dog can be a big undertaking, and can require a lot of
              planning. If the dog is not a good match for the family, or the
              family is not equipped with the information needed to properly
              take care of a dog, the dog could end up right back at the
              shelter.

          Once the usability studies had been conducted, the notes from each
          study were transferred to post it notes and organized
          into categories. Though these categories themselves do not constitute
          themes, themes can be gleamed from them. For instance, the categories
          of 'confused with adopt CTA', 'clarification regarding process', and 'didn't know what to do next' categories together indicate a theme. That theme could
          be called, 'adoption process'

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <h3>But what does it mean?!</h3>
        <p>
          Once
          <span style="font-weight: 600">themes</span>
          have been identified, they need to be turned into insights. In the
          previous example, we found the theme 'adoption process'. What does that mean? Since many of the participants needed clarification on the adoption process, it can be infered that the current layout may lead to customers calling the shelter instead of using the built in system. Working off of this insight, we can rework the user flow to be more intuitive.

            <p>
              Based on the feedback from the usability studies, one of the main issues was confusion with the adoption process. Part of the solution was to add an adoption process tab in the header leading to a page that outlined the steps for the adoption process. We also included additional prompts to clarify the process with the users as they progress through the steps.

            <h3><span>Next</span> Steps</h3>
            <p>
              Another round of usability studies focused on the participant's ability to complete the adoption and visit scheduling process.

            <p>
              Various other suggestions were made including fostering information and events. These items have been added to the about us section but it is unclear if this is the best location for these items.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once another round of testing has been completed, if the majority of issues have been resolved, a report will be sent to development, while the UX team begins a new design sprint based on new suggestions.

              WCAG 2.1 Color Contrast: The company wanted establish a color
              palette for the restaurant that mimicked the German flag. This
              produced a few challenges in accessability in terms of making sure
              all text was visible to as many users as possible. Per WCAG
              guidelins, the minimum minimum contrast ratio for large-scale text
              is 3:1 and 4.5:1 for body text. The colors chosen (red #d7263d,
              yellow #fbb13c, and black #1b2021) were able to meet these
              guidelines, as long as red background wasused with white text
              (ratio 4.96:1) and yellow background was used with black (ratio
              8.98:1) was used for body text.

              Iconography and images were used as often as possible for
              individuals with difficulty reading english. Variable language
              versions for the app are being tested with emphasis on the
              languages popular in the immediate area of the restaurant (Spanish
              and Vietnamese).
