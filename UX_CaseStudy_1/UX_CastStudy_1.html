              This case study is for a hypothetical restaurant called Guntz
              Burger, a German restaurant in need of a mobile app. They are
              having issues with website activity not translating into
              conversions, and management is hoping a user friendly app will
              decrease drop off rates.

              Interiews were conducted with users who use restaurant apps at
              least once a month, whether it's to order online, make a
              reservation, or plan an outing. Research participants ranged from
              ages 27 to 62, and came from various economic backgrounds. All
              participants were from the greater Houston area, since Guntz
              Burger only has one location, and its target audience includes
              potential customers within 30 minutes driving distance.

              pain points helped out greatly during the definiation phase when
              it came to creating personas and brainstorming features.

              The overwhelming consensus amongst our site's users is that they
              often hesistant to choose our establishment due to a lack of
              transparency. This is not a trust issue, but more that they find
              it difficult to have their questions answered when they are
              choosing a restaurant.

            <p>
              Since the biggest problem our customers face is finding answers to
              their questions, the solution seems obvious. Give them the
              answers! More specifically, the proposed solution is to present
              answers at points of the user journey when the questions would
              initially arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can be done by adding various pages and pop ups to our site.
              Expaning our 'About Us' section to include images and layouts of
              the restaurant would go a long way in helping Gerald, and pop ups
              in our menus would help put Tilly at ease.

              constraint. The time constraint forces us to put down whatever
              comes to mind, without stopping to overthink. Once 5 iterations
              have been drawn out, we can take the strongest elements from each

              Once a final paper wireframe has been drafted, it can be converted
              into a low-fidelity digital wireframe. This enables the use of
              tools such as Figma or Adobe XD for protoyping. Figma was used in
              this case study.
              <br />
              This example of the converted homepage highlights the key features
              of the screen that were crucial for the page's functionality.

                than just menu information to make their decision, so additional
                information needs to be easily accessible.

        <h2>Identifying Themes</h2>
        <h3>Critiques for your consideration</h3>
        <p>
          Once the usability studies had been conducted, the notes from each
          study were transferred to digital post it notes on Miro and organized
          into categories. Though these categories themselves do not constitute
          themes, themes can be gleamed from them. For instance, the categories
          of menu organization, the allergy icon, and the ingredients and
          substitutions categories together indicate a theme. That theme could
          be called, 'issues with menus and menu items'
        </p>

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <h3>But what does it mean?!</h3>
        <p>
          Once
          <span style="font-weight: 600">themes</span>
          have been identified, they need to be turned into insights. In the
          previous example, we found the theme 'issues with menus and menu
          items'. What does that mean? It can be infered that since users had
          issues with the menus or menu items, these are areas where pain points
          are leading to drop offs. Working off of this insight, many of the
          menu options, filters, and icons that felt confusing have been
          reworked to be more intuitive.

              While some of the terminology and submenus have changed, we need
              to figure out if the new options are an improvement.

            <p>
              Some users would like additional features to make the reservation

              Some additional content may need to be added to the site in order
              for most users to have enough data to make a decision on whether
              or not they’d eat at this restaurant.

              WCAG 2.1 Color Contrast: The company wanted establish a color
              palette for the restaurant that mimicked the German flag. This
              produced a few challenges in accessability in terms of making sure
              all text was visible to as many users as possible. Per WCAG
              guidelins, the minimum minimum contrast ratio for large-scale text
              is 3:1 and 4.5:1 for body text. The colors chosen (red #d7263d,
              yellow #fbb13c, and black #1b2021) were able to meet these
              guidelines, as long as red background wasused with white text
              (ratio 4.96:1) and yellow background was used with black (ratio
              8.98:1) was used for body text.

              versions for the app are being tested with emphasis on the
              languages popular in the immediate area of the restaurant (Spanish
