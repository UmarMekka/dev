            <h3><span>User</span> Research</h3>
            <p>
              We sent questionnaires to potential users from a wide range of demographics, and asked them the following questions relating to their donation habits:
              <ul>
                <li>How often do you donate items (such as clothes, food, furniture, or household items) to charities?</li>
                <li>How often is this triggered by you wanting to give something away vs. hearing that a charity needs something?</li>
                <li>For the former, how do you usually go about deciding who or where to donate the item?</li>
                <li>
                  What are some frustrations you have with donations processes that you have gone through in the past?</li>
                <li>What are your main motivators for donating items?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Using the answers from the questionnaires, we created empathy maps summing up what the users said, their thoughts on donation in general, the actions they took, and their feelings about donations. Using these empathy maps, we were able to glean pain points outs related to donation items as well as group similar themes together into personas.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mini-column">
            <h3><span>Pain</span>  Points</h3>
            <h4>Trust</h4>
            <p>
              Almost all the respondants conveyed a feeling of mistrust towards general donation drop-off centers. Concerns focused on how these centers were handling donations, how much they were repricing items for, and how much of the money actually went to a cause.
            </p>

            <h4>Where to go?</h4>
            <p>
              Many of the participants stated that they often found it difficult finding charities that actually needed the items they were donating. They often donate items in bulk at very busy times (moving day or spring cleaning), and usually end up giving up and donating everything to a general drop-off location that they don't trust.
            </p>

            <h4>Paperwork</h4>
            <p>
              While not an immediate pain point, some participants pointed out that it can be frustrating during tax season when they can't find receipts for what they donated or were unable to keep track of their donations.

               Many users stated that one of their motivators to donate was that they didn't want to throw out items on a whim and help reduce the amount of trash going into landfills. As the primary color associated with nature and recycling, green seemed an obvious choice. Added benefits included its symbolism with piety and sincerity, aleviating the hesitation of many users who may not yet trust the charities.

        <h2>Identifying Themes</h2>
        <h3>Critiques for your consideration</h3>
        <p>
          Once the usability studies had been conducted, the notes from each
          study were transferred to post it notes and organized
          into categories. Though these categories themselves do not constitute
          themes, themes can be gleamed from them. For instance, the categories
          of 'confused with adopt CTA', 'clarification regarding process', and 'didn't know what to do next' categories together indicate a theme. That theme could
          be called, 'adoption process'

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <h3>But what does it mean?!</h3>
        <p>
          Once
          <span style="font-weight: 600">themes</span>
          have been identified, they need to be turned into insights. In the
          previous example, we found the theme 'adoption process'. What does that mean? Since many of the participants needed clarification on the adoption process, it can be infered that the current layout may lead to customers calling the shelter instead of using the built in system. Working off of this insight, we can rework the user flow to be more intuitive.

            <h3>Priority 1</h3>
            <p>
              Since none of the participants were able to complete the ‘post a donation’ process, the process needs to be made clearer. Some of the suggestions included a clearly labeled submit button, as well as a process tracker. This improvement should help to increase the task success rate.

            <h3>Priority 2</h3>
            <p>
              Since 80% of users became lost during the trip planner process, and 60% of them couldn’t find the ‘add to trip’ button, the process needs to be simplified to clear up the confusion. Some possible improvements might include making it easier to find the ‘add to trip’ button, and allowing users to use the map from the beginning. These improvements should help to decrease time-on-task.</p>

            <h3>Priority 3</h3>
            <p>Since 40% of users mentioned that it would be helpful to know where they are in certain processes, the processes need to be outlined to make the steps and goals clearer. Some suggestions included adding process trackers, confirmation pop-ups, and tutorials. These improvements should help to reduce user error rates.</p>

            <p>
              Based on the feedback from the usability studies, one of the main issues was confusion with the adoption process. Part of the solution was to add an adoption process tab in the header leading to a page that outlined the steps for the adoption process. We also included additional prompts to clarify the process with the users as they progress through the steps.

            <h3><span>Next</span> Steps</h3>
            <p>
              Another round of usability studies focused on the participant's ability to complete the adoption and visit scheduling process.

            <p>
              Various other suggestions were made including fostering information and events. These items have been added to the about us section but it is unclear if this is the best location for these items.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once another round of testing has been completed, if the majority of issues have been resolved, a report will be sent to development, while the UX team begins a new design sprint based on new suggestions.

              WCAG 2.1 Color Contrast: The colors chosen were matched with either black or white text and made sure to adhere with WCAG
              guidelines, the minimum minimum contrast ratio for large-scale text
              is 3:1 and 4.5:1 for body text. This is to ensure that any users who may have difficulty discerning differences in low contrast colors can still use the application.</p></br><p>Considerations were also made when labelling the headers in the code of the application, in order to ensure that screen readers could navigate the application easily.
